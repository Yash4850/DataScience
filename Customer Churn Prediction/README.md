Context:
Any business wants to maximize the number of customers. To achieve this goal, it is important not only 
to try to attract new ones, but also to retain existing ones. Retaining a client will cost the company less 
than attracting a new one. In addition, a new client may be weakly interested in business services and it 
will be difficult to work with him, while old clients already have the necessary data on interaction with 
the service.
Accordingly, predicting the churn, we can react in time and try to keep the client who wants to leave. 
Based on the data about the services that the client uses, we can make him a special offer, trying to 
change his decision to leave the operator. Thanks to this, the task of retention will be easier to 
implement than the task of attracting new users, about which we do not know anything yet. 
Objective:
We are provided with a dataset from a telecommunications company. The data contains information 
about almost six thousand users, their demographic characteristics, the services they use, the duration 
of using the operator's services, the method of payment, and the amount of payment.
The task is to analyze the data and predict the churn of users (to identify people who will and will not 
renew their contract) by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building Machine Learning prediction 
models. We investigate the following tasks in this report:
• Exploratory Data Analysis.
• Research of dependencies and formulation of hypotheses.
• Is there any bias in the dataset? How can it be addressed?
• Building prediction models and compare the quality of the obtained models?
• How can we improve techniques previously proposed?
